    "\n",
    "The police is interested in whether people are driving drunk. Therefore, they sometimes set up a \"fuik\", or a trap, where they block a road and test everyone that passes for drunk driving. In this case, they use a test. Like any test, this test is not perfect. If a person is drunk, the test reports positive for drunkenness 99.99% of the time. If the person is not drunk, the test reports positive for drunkenness 5% of the time. This exercise is about probabilistic reasoning in this situation.\n",
